a.csv - a very simple and generic csv, should be valid (** - had to reorder mergesort; was sorting in ascending, not desc order)
b.csv - used to check whether an unquoted name column will give the proper error when a tweeter has quotes around it (expected: invalid)
c.csv - checks the opposite of b.csv; a quoted name with unquoted tweeters
d.csv - doubly quoted name, name column with one quote; both considered invalid (should not be able to find a valid name column)
e.csv - two name columns (duplicate name headers) - > Invalid
f.csv - tweeter has a single quote on either left or right side -> invalid
g.csv - skip over empty line (\n) with no problem
h.csv - no header -> invalid file (1st row doesnt have a name column)
i.csv - more than 10 tweeters; should only print 10
j.csv - mismatch between number of columns in header and in other rows
k.csv - empty column at end, no problem, empty values within the csv
l.csv - no rows besides the header -> valid
m.csv - quotes within tweeter name are fine
n.csv - test removal of newline and return characters
o.csv - newlines are removed, if found at the end of a string
p.csv - only a name column, no quotes
q.csv - only a name column, with quotes
r.csv - "name" only
